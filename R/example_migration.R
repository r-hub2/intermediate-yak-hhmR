#' example_migration
#'
#' Fake migration dataset used to demonstrate the functionality of the hhm function in the hhmR package.
#' It contains the information on the number of people who have moved between a series of fictional
#' geographies. The geographies themselves have a hierarchical structure, with each county existing within
#' a smaller subset of regions.
