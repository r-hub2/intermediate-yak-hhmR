\description{
Fake migration dataset used to demonstrate the functionality of the tshm function in the hhmR package.
It contains the information on the number of people who have immigrated a series of fictional
geographies over the years 2011 to 2015. The geographies themselves have a hierarchical structure,
with each county existing within a smaller subset of regions.
